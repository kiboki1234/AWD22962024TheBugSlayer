## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: For building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- **React Router**: For handling multi-page navigation within the app.
- **Redux or Context API**: For state management across components.
- **Chart.js / D3.js**: For data visualization through responsive and customizable charts.
- **Styled Components / CSS Modules**: For styling components in a modular and reusable way.
- **Service Workers**: To enable offline functionality and PWA capabilities.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or OneSignal**: For handling push notifications.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: For the backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: For handling RESTful API requests and managing backend logic.
- **External Sports APIs**: (e.g., RapidAPI, SportsRadar) for accessing real-time sports data.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user preferences and cached data.
- **Mongoose**: For MongoDB data modeling.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and session management.
- **Socket.io**: For real-time data updates and communication between the server and client.

### DevOps and Testing
- **Docker**: To containerize the application and ensure a consistent environment across development and production.
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library**: For unit and integration testing of React components.
- **Mocha / Chai**: For backend testing of Node.js and API routes.
- **Postman**: For API testing and validation.
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration (CI) and automated deployment processes.
- **Vercel** or **Netlify**: For deploying the frontend.
- **Heroku** or **Render**: For deploying the backend.

## Benefits of the PWA Approach

1. **Push Notifications**: Users stay informed about favorite teams or players in real time.
2. **Device Installation**: The PWA can be installed on any device, functioning like a native app.
3. **Offline Access**: Caching of data enables offline viewing of previously accessed statistics.
4. **Optimized Performance**: Fast loading times and smooth user experience through caching and service workers.
